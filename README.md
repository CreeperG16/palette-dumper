# Serenity Palette Dumper

## Getting started...

First download/clone the repo onto your machine.
You then need to have Bun.sh installed on your machine.
Run ```bun install``` and then ```bun start```, the process will error out stating to install the latest version of bds to the server folder.
Once completed, run ```bun start``` once again, and the palette should be dumped.
